# Teaching Qualities

## Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy centers on history as a tool for developing critical thinking rather than memorizing facts.  Drawing from my military leadership experience and training in multicultural education, I create inclusive environments where diverse students, veterans, working adults, and traditional learners can succeed through structured support and high expectations.

I employ active learning strategies that engage students as preliminary historians, analyzing primary sources and connecting past events to contemporary issues.  My digital humanities background allows me to integrate technology meaningfully, using interactive maps and multimedia to make history accessible and relevant.

I believe in meeting students where they are academically while maintaining rigorous standards.  Clear expectations, regular feedback, and multiple assessment opportunities ensure all students can demonstrate their understanding.  My goal extends beyond content delivery. I aim to develop citizens who think critically, communicate effectively, and engage thoughtfully with complex issues, all skills essential for democratic participation and lifelong learning.
