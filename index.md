### About Me
Hello, my name is Tyler! I'm originally from a small town in Nebraska called Fremont, though I've also had the opportunity to live in Hawaii and South Carolina. I'm passionate about all things pop culture, whether it's catching the latest movies and TV shows or diving into a good video game. When I can find the time, I also love to travel and explore new places.
