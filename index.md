### About Me

I'm a PhD student in Texts and Technology at the University of Central Florida, specializing in Public History and Digital Humanities.  My research explores how digital methods and spatial technologies can transform our understanding of historical spaces and make the past more accessible to contemporary audiences.

Before transitioning to academia, I served as a Sergeant and Squad Leader in the United States Marine Corps (2015-2019), where I developed leadership skills and analytical approaches that now inform my work in education and research.  My military experience taught me the importance of clear communication, adaptability, and meeting people where they are, principles that guide my teaching philosophy today.

I hold a Master's degree in History from the University of Nebraska Omaha (2025), where I was recognized as the Outstanding Graduate Student and received the George & Virginia Dare Shuflata Master's Graduate Fellowship. I also earned dual bachelor's degrees in History and Classics from the College of Charleston (2022), graduating Magna Cum Laude.

Currently, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Center for Humanities and Digital Research at UCF, where I collaborate with faculty on research design, student engagement initiatives, and the development of digital humanities projects.  My work combines traditional historical inquiry with cutting-edge digital tools like ArcGIS to create immersive, interactive experiences that bring historical sites and narratives to life.

Originally from Fremont, Nebraska, I've had the opportunity to live in Hawaii and South Carolina.  When I'm not immersed in research or teaching, I'm passionate about pop culture,whether it's catching the latest films and TV shows, diving into video games, or traveling to explore new places and historical sites.
